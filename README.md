- I’m Dr. Felix Panis. After finishing my master studies in pharmacy I completed my PhD studies in chemistry. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Vienna at the Department of Biophysical Chemistry.
  
- My reseacrh combines biochemical investigations of recombinantly expressed enzymes with computational and AI based methods. My work is focused on investigating enzyme kinetics, recombinant expression and purification of proteins.
  
- I am interested in developing computational models for:
  * phylogenetic classification of protein sequences.
  * identifying protein domains.
  * analyzing and interpreting metagenomic seqeuencing data.
  * evaluating data from enzyme kinetic measurements.
 
- always open for collaborations.
